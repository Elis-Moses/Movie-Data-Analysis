Project Title: Data Retrieval and Integration from European Movie Companies Dataset

Summary: In this project, I focused on enhancing data retrieval by effectively combining columns from a
dataset of European movie companies. The objective was to streamline data integration processes,
enabling a more comprehensive analysis of the film industry across Europe. Through careful selection
and merging of relevant columns, I improved the dataset's usability and facilitated more accurate and
insightful analyses. This project highlights my skills in data manipulation, cleaning, and integration,
critical for driving informed decision-making in data-driven environments.
